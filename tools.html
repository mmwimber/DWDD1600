            <h1>Tools</h1>
            <p>Having the correct tools is a crutial part in any hobby you decide to pick up. Crochet has many tools and some may be completely new to you. Below we will list and describe the use of the starter tools you will need.</p>
            <h2>Most Basic Tools</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yarn:</strong> Without yarn, there is nothing to crochet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crochet hook:</strong>The most important thing to know about crochet hooks is they have different sizes. You will need to choose your yarn first and the yarn label will tell you what size hook you will need.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Other Very Helpful Tools</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scissors:</strong>When a project is completed, or you want to permanently switch colors, you will need to cut your yarn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stitch Markers:</strong>These handy tools will help you keep your place when you have to pause your project. (A safety pin would do the job just as well)</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="patterns.html">Pattern:</a></strong>There are plenty of interesting crochet patterns for a variety of projects and these will help as you're just getting started.</li>
                </ul>

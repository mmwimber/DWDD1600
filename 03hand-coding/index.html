            <h1>Crochet</h1>
            <p>Crochet is a type of textile art that is easy to learn the basics and has a lot of growth opportunity to continue to keep your interest alive. Crochet projects can be as simple as a one stitch, one color square or it can be as complex as you can imagine. Crochet Rookie is here to help beginners start from the basics and learn about the different <a href="tools.html#sign">tools</a> and <a href="stitches.html#sign">stitches</a> and how to start reading <a href="patterns.html">patterns</a>.</p>
            <h2>Crochet vs. Knitting</h2>
            <p>Crochet and knitting are both textile art that deal with yarn and needles. Oftentimes, because of these big similarities, many people don't really know the difference between the two art forms. I will highlight some of them below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crochet uses a 9single hook to connect loops of yarn while kniting uses two needles to make loops and move the loops onto the other needle.</li>
                    <li>Crochet is easier for self-taught beginners and knitting uses a wider range of tools which makes it more complicated.</li>
                    <li>Crochet projects are easier to pull on the string to undo wrong stitching. This also means you do have to be more careful to not drop a stitch accidentally.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>How to Start</h2>
            <p>The first thing you should do to get started on your crochet journey is to get the right <a href="tools.html">tools</a>. We will go into more details regarding tools but here are some basics:</p>
